# joyent-imgadm, sdc-imgadm, updates-imgadm Changelog

## 1.3.0

- Support for IMGAPI server channels. Examples:

        updates-imgadm channels
        updates-imgadm list -o uuid,name,channels
        updates-imgadm -C release list
        sdc-imgadm import $uuid -S https://updates.joyent.com?channel=staging

## 1.2.5

        # remove the 'description' for this image
        sdc-imgadm update UUID description=

## 1.2.3

- [IMGAPI-249]: Added suport for 'export' command.
- [IMGAPI-249]: CLI constructor now takes an array option called 'excludeCmds'

  Authorization header format per

  Previously these were reported as "InternalError"s.

  subcommands.
